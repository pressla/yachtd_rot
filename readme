pgns are from canboat pgns.json

CAN1 is a small subnet connecting rudder sensor for test purpose
CAN2 is the rest of the network and has a wifi gateway connected and CAN Log viewer on the PC

to emulate the missing anemometer and hull compass, this message is sent by CAN Log viewer
09F11299 FF D0 08 D0 03 00 55 FD

1. Hull heading
2. mast heading
3. AWA @ Mast

for debug purpose, the HDG message is sent and has deviation and variation used to display mast and hull heading difference

ISSUES:
1. the gauges connected by the wifi hotspot do not update on NAV data, it only shows rudder and ENV data.
2. Attitude data is not transformed from 0183 to N2K segment.
